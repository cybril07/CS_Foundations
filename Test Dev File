Don’t worry I’m working on getting through my readings and assignments. Just because I haven’t committed any code here doesn’t mean I’m not learning anything, but if you recall the curriculum I’m currently working on doesn’t have me working on any direct coding just yet, not for another unit and a half at the earliest from what we guessed. But I am just about done with my readings for the day. So yay at least I’m making some progress. However, since I will be working late today I probably won’t add anything more until tomorrow night at the earliest. Just know that I’m still working on stuff.
